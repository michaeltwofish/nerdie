* Install [node](http://nodejs.org/).
* Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/).
* Clone nerdie from the URL on this page.
* Run `npm install` in the nerdie directory and npm will install all the modules required.
* Copy `config.json.default` to `config.json` and edit it to your liking. It's in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed.
* Make a directory `db` in the nerdie directory to hold databases, such as your Tell database.
* Run `node server.js`, and your bot should show up in the configured channels.
