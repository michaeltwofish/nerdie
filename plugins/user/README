User (non-distributed) plugins go here.

They can be in any of these forms (where pluginname is your plugin's name):

* nerdie/plugins/user/pluginname.js
* nerdie/plugins/user/pluginname/index.js
* nerdie/plugins/user/pluginname/pluginname.js

All files in nerdie/plugins/user/ (except this README) are `.gitignore`d by
Nerdie core.
